You are required to perform classification on diabetes dataset in the scikit-learn library using Python on Jupyter notebook. 

You should also answer the following questions:
- How many instances in the data
- How did the classifier perform
- Provide the decision tree

Run another model using random forest and compared its performance against decision tree.

To further improve random forest, you run bagging on random forest, will the result improve?

Finally run a significance test on all three models and report the outcome
