the various types of data
- transcation data
- document data
- sequence data >>> sequence of individual entities or objects
- sequential data >>> data with time associated with it
- spatial data >>> geographical location

what is data
- info about objects with attributes

what is attributes
- description about data

types of attributes values
- nominal >>> profession, id, eye color
    - enough info to distinguish one from the others
    - has distinctiveness
- ordinal >>> grades, height
    - enough info to distinguish one from the other and order them
    - has distinctiveness and order
- binary >>> medical test yes and or
    - 2 states
- interval >>> body temperature
    - measure on scale of equal sized units
    - the differences are meningful
    - can be added and subtract
- ratio >>> length, time
    - differences and ratio between attribute values are meningful

why do we preprocess data
- data is inconsistent, incomplete and contains noise

any reason?
- quality decison comes from quality data

what should we do in preprocessing
- data cleaning
- data integration
- data transformation
- data reduction

what is binning and their types
- equal width
    - divides the range into n intervals of equal size or uniform grid
    - not good on skewed data
- equal depth
    - divides the range into n intervals with about the same number samples
    - good data scaling
    - difficult for categorical attributes

how to transform
- smoothing
- aggregation
- generalization
- normalization
- feature construction

data reduction techniques
- data cube aggregation
- dimensionality reduction
- numerosity reduction
- discretization and concept hierarchy generation
